# ETL mini project (Project 2 )

For this ETL mini-project, you will collaborate with a partner to build an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas, incorporating either dictionary methods or regular expressions for data extraction and transformation. After transforming the data, you will create four CSV files, which will be used to develop an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and define a table schema. Finally, you will load the data from the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.
